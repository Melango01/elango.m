Earthquake Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict earthquakes using machine learning techniques and earthquake-related data. Earthquake prediction is a challenging and complex task, and while this project may not provide real-time predictions, it offers insights into historical earthquake data and potential patterns.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-prediction.git
cd earthquake-prediction
Set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the earthquake data (explained in the Data section).

Run the prediction models as described in the Usage section.

Data
The data used in this project is not included in the repository due to its size. You can obtain earthquake data from reputable sources such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS) or other earthquake monitoring organizations. Once you have the data, place it in the data/ directory.

The data should include information about past earthquakes, including their location, magnitude, depth, and date. Ensure that the data is in a format compatible with the project's data preprocessing routines.

Usage
To predict earthquakes using this project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have the necessary data in the data/ directory.

Preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Train and evaluate the prediction models (explained in the Models section):

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new earthquake data.

Models
This project includes several machine learning models for earthquake prediction. The main models used are:

Model A: (brief description)
Model B: (brief description)
Model C: (brief description)
You can find detailed information about each model in the models/ directory.
